# School-Physics
School project which models some school tasks in physics

This is an application that I made while learning in 10-11 grades in school.
The goal was to make "a serious" app which can be used in school lessons like a visual aid.
App includes 2 levels: the first models law of conservation of impulse, the second - diffraction of light.

Lately it was turned into scientific paper ang got the second place at
"Regional theoretical and practical conference for school students" in Udmurt Republic, Russia in 2015.
It also took part in MIPT's "Start in science" conferencion in 2015. Got no places because I had got chicken pox :(


App uses OpenGL library.
Was made in MS Visual Studio 2008.
Code made by me, graphics by Michail Stolarov.
